# HASH Box
It is the prototype of a stingless bee box that uses the concept of INPA boxes, thus facilitating handling. The objectives of this model are:
* facilitate management through 4 blocks: base, nest, pestle and hedgehog
* low cost and durable
* be scalable
* reduce human contact during the honey extraction process
* test the use of prefabricated honey pots
* be portable
