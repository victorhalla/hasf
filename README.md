# HASH Box
It is the prototype of a stingless bee box that uses the concept of INPA boxes, thus facilitating handling. The objectives of this model are:
* facilitate management through 4 blocks: base, nest, pestle and hedgehog
* low cost and durable
* be scalable
* reduce human contact during the honey extraction process
* test the use of prefabricated honey pots
* be portable

## Motivation
In February 2015, [Flow Hive](https://www.honeyflow.com/) launched their Indiegogo campaign and surpassed their $70,000 goal 8 minutes later. They went on to raise $2.18 million in the first day. This shows how much people are interested in the topic and are willing to invest in beekeeping.
I found the idea brilliant and innovative, but when researching how I could create European or Africanized bees here in Brazil I came across a series of problems. Although it looks easy, it is not that simple and requires a license for creation. Many of the species available here are quite aggressive and even with this easy device it would require a handling course and protective equipment.
After research I discovered the stingless bees that in general are much less aggressive, their colonies are smaller and produce excellent quality honey, being very easy to breed. Embrapa Brazil, together with the Brazilian Association of Bee Studies, offers a free Meliponiculture course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv78ZATrcTQ
During my research I noticed that the most used hive model in Brazil and even in other countries like Astralia is the INPA that were conceived by the researcher Fernando Oliveira when he worked at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA). The box model was baptized with its own name, Fernando Oliveira, however it became popular with the name of the institute.
The model was developed with the aim of facilitating the work of honey farmers. Thus optimizing the division of swarms and facilitating the collection of honey.
INPA boxes are made up of three basic modules: Nest, Uper Nest and Honey. So the size of the modules and the amount of honey pots will depend on each species of stingless bees that will be created in these INPA boxes.

## Modular Design
The proposed design has 5 blocks:
* Base: used for the entry of bees
* Nest: place where bees will place their honeycombs
* Over-nest: place where the bees will place the brood combs used for the division of the hive
* Honey Chamber: places where bees deposited honey
* Cover: beehive cover

## Heat and Cold resistant
Bees are very sensitive to changes in temperature, so essential to a stable environment. In nature, they use tree hollows that have excellent thermal resistance. To guarantee this thermal comfort, all blocks have a 2 cm layer that must be filled with Styrofoam. Other insulators can also be used. As the walls have a thickness of 0.1 cm to give greater rigidity, a mixture of cement with styrofoam can be used.

## Durable Materials
For testing purposes, 3D models are being printed with different types of material such as PLA, ABS, PET-G among others. The future goal is to make molds for the injection of recyclable plastic.

## Portable
The hive needs to be portable, allowing easy handling and transportation when necessary. The lid has a handle for loading and the base has a threaded entrance to close the hive during transport

## Easy to Operate

## Low Cost
